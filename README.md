# aTRAM2_contigstitching_workflow
Adaptation of methods in the Systematic Biology aTRAM paper (2017), for improved paralog handling and aTRAM2 functionality.

In ATRAM2_Saxifragales_loop_exonerate.sh, the variables set at the beginning need to be changed to your paths and an array of your library name patterns. Otherwise these scripts are ready to use. Make sure the perl scripts from the original pipeline (https://github.com/juliema/exon_stitching) are in the path.
